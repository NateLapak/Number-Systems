# About The Project
This project converts displays a table that converts decimal numbers into binary, octal and hexadecimal. This was an assignment for my CTS 30 course and I wanted
to upload this assignment to github because I thought it was enjoyable to make and to demonstrate that I am capable of programming in Java.
