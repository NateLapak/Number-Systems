# Brief description
Simple java program that converts decimal to binary, octal and hexadecimal starting at 1 and ending at 256.

# Functions 
This program contains functions that converts decimal numbers into binary, octal and hexadecimal then displays it on a table.
It contains the class numberSystems and three different functions
  - decimalToOctal
  - decimalToBinary
  - decimalToHexadecimal
each with the parameter that takes in a decimal number to be converted.

# Purpose
This project was part of my CTS 30 high school course. I practiced programming in Java and learned all about the different number systems and it's
uses in computer science. This is more of a minor project that I thought I would upload to github because I enjoyed making it and it demonstrates I can
program in Java!
